## Tips
Inorder to smoothly view/manipulate the website tabs in the full screen mode, a few shortcuts are recommended to be used.
It may vary between browsers, here we take **Chrome** as an example:
- **Swap to the next Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` then press `Tab`
- **Swap to the prior Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` and `Shift` then press `Tab`
- **Jump to specific Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` then press `The number/index of tab`
- **Jump to First/Last Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` then press `1 to the first tab/9 to the last tab`
- **Close Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` then press `W`
- **Reopen the last closed Tab** - Hold `Ctrl` and `Shift` then press `T`
